## [0.8.0](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2026-09-02)

### 🎯 Core

- ✨ **Hyper HTTP Server**: Replaced the Pingora HTTP layer with a Hyper and Tower HTTP/1.1 server. Added a shared middleware interface, FR [#35](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/35).
- ✨ **Runtime Mode API**: Added `\Rapira\Mode` and `\Rapira\get_mode()` for Classic, Worker, and Dispatcher modes. Renamed `NotInWorkerModeError` to `NoDispatcherError`, FR [#77](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/77) (thanks @roxblnfk).
- ✨ **PHP Handler Lifetime**: Built one `PHPHandler` for each connection and separated per-request state, FR [#99](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/99).
- 🐛 **Worker Shutdown**: Stopped the per-request destructor sweep. Boot shutdown functions now run once when the worker exits. Long-lived boot objects remain usable across requests, BUG [#82](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/82) (thanks @Zylius).

### 📦 `static_files` middleware

- ✨ **Static File Serving**: Added configurable static file serving. File misses continue to PHP, FR [#76](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/76).
- ✨ **Static File Cache**: Added a per-worker memory cache with one-second revalidation, a 16 MiB capacity, and a 256 KiB limit for each file, FR [#98](https://github.com/rapira-rs/rapira/issues/98).
